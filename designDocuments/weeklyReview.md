<li>Created Git repository for project.</li>
<li>Created WireFrames for each planned page.</li>
<li>Wrote user stories</li>
<li>Found relevant API to consume</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Project will be an overwatch companion app. Found a great API that will provide all the data needed.
</p>

<h3>Week 2</h3>

<p>07/12/21</p>

<h4>Tasks Completed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Created entity package and Profile, Role, User entities</li>
<li>Finalized Database design</li>
<li>Started writing unit tests for entity classes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    All base entities created allowing users to sign up, sign in, create a profile + admin capabilities.
</p>

<h3>Week 3</h3>

<p>07/19/21</p>

<h4>Tasks Completed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Database created</li>
<li>Hibernate annotation added to entity classes</li>
<li>Unit tests completed for all entities</li>
<li>Initital API class & unit testing </li>
</ul>

<p>
Database set up and hibernate annotation added to existing entity classes. Unit tests were then written for all planned functionality.
Wrote the intial api class and a unit test for it. API : https://timomak.github.io/Overwatch-API/#/
</p>

<h3>Week 4</h3>

<p>07/26/21</p>

<h4>Tasks Completed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Discovered API had been taken offline</li>
<li>Researched alternatives</li>
<li>Looked for other games with decent APIs I could pivot to</li>
<li>Found Overwatch stat tracking website that could fill the role of the api</li>
</ul>

<p>
This week my unit testing for the API was suddenly failing. After some troubleshooting I realized that it was the API itself and not my code that was the issue.
Very discouraging, I began looking for alternative game API's that I didnt have to pay excessively for thinking I could pivot to a different game.
After not finding anything applicable I stumbled upon this website https://overwatchtracker.com/. Instead of having the user's profile data imported via
API the user would look themselves up on this website and enter the data into the Overwatch Companion App. While not as slick as my initial concept it
at least allowed to stick to my approved plan.
</p>



<h3>Week 5</h3>

<p>08/02/21</p>

<h4>Tasks Completed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reworked entity classes to work around stat tracker website</li>
<li>Added new database table and entity class for Hero images + descriptions since the API will no longer display them</li>
<li>Wrote unit tests for new entity class</li>
<li>Implemented admin log in and protected pages</li>
<li>Created servlets for planned functionality</li>
</ul>

<p>
To make up for the lack of API I created a hero table in the database along with and entity class and unit tests. This way I could still display
hero images, names and descriptions. With all entity classes created and all unit tests passing the servlets for each planned function were written.
</p>

<h3>Week 6</h3>

<p>08/09/21</p>

<h4>Tasks Completed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Created JSP pages for all planned wire frames</li>
<li>Continued creating servlets for each planned function</li>
</ul>

<p>
Continued building off of last week. Finished creating all JSPs along with the servlets related to each one.
</p>

<h3>Week 7</h3>

<p>08/16/21</p>

<h4>Tasks Completed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added CSS to all pages</li>
<li>Displayed relevant database data with expression langauge on jsps</li>
<li>Implemented data tables where applicable to allow search functions etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Finished the project. During this week the https://overwatchtracker.com/ was also taken offline due to lack of interest.
If I was to redo this project I would definitely have chosen a game with a more active player base. Overwatch seems to be on its way out.
